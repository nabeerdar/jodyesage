                    The midnight chase<br />
                    The midnight escape<br />
                    She needs her space<br />
                    She’ll come my way<br />
                    Love in trade my yin to my yang<br />
                    balance is the way its scripted on the page<br />
                    <br />
                    She’s bright as the sun<br />
                    Im light with the moon<br />
                    Yeah she is the one<br />
                    Out of the few<br />
                    <br />
                    Worth more than a ton<br />
                    Its something I knew<br />
                    Get rid of the old<br />
                    Our love is renewed<br />
                    <br />
                    We flexing together<br />
                    we take on pressure<br />
                    Break ups are never<br />
                    we balance in measures<br />
                    <br />
                    secrets to tell her<br />
                    our distance is farther<br />
                    It makes things so harder it’s sweet but it’s bitter<br />
                    <br />
                    Aw yeah uh huh<br />
                    Uh huh aw yeah<br />
                    <br />
                    The Feminine and The Masculine<br />
                    It’s beautiful it’s Genuine<br />
                    I feel the magic is coming in<br />
                    Leaving me with questions<br />
                    <br />
                    Jumping out of the window pane<br />
                    I wonder if she feels the same<br />
                    Sneaking out to her house tonight<br />
                    Protecting me with her lie<br />
                    <br />
                    Back and forth tug of war<br />
                    like child’s play healing sores<br />
                    Cuz Love is a maze<br />
                    Let love play it’s course<br />
                    and Balance will restore<br />
                    Like never before<br />
                    <br />
                    She’s bright as the sun<br />
                    Im light with the moon<br />
                    Yeah she is the one<br />
                    Out of the few<br />
                    <br />
